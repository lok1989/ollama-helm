I hope you’re doing well. I would like to formally request leave from July 20th to August 9th, as I have planned a personal trip to visit my family in India during that period.

Please let me know if any adjustments are needed to ensure smooth handover and coverage while I’m away. I will make sure all pending work is up to date before my departure and will coordinate with the team as needed.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your approval.
